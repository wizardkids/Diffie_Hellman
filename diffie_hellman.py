 Description: This program includes two major functions:
     (i) DH key exchange
    (ii) AES encryption

Unlike other encryption programs that I have written, this one includes a mechanism for secure transmission of the key to decryption.  The generate_DH() function generates keys for BOTH the sender and the recipient. Both parties then have the key to encrypt/decrypt the text, since encryption uses the key that both parties have.

This introduces a potential confusion, since in real life, the sender would generate a public and private set of keys, and pass the public key to the recipient. The recipient would do the same, passing their key to the sender. Now each party has the other party's public key and, with their own secret number, both party's can generate a shared key to use for encryption and decryption.

Public keys are stored in "sender_key_file.json" and "recipient_key_file.json", along with each party's "secret" or private number. These data can be used to generate the shared key that is required to encrypt and decrypt text. Public keys are meant to be public or, at least, not secure. Obviously, storing the sender's and recipient's secret number alongside the public keys is the epitome of insecurity. But that is the only way this program can work!

    b^secret_number mod m. This formula is public. b and m are known to both parties. m must be a prime number.

    "secret_number" is known only to the parties and each party has a different "secret_number". In this function, a "secret_number" is selected randomly and assigned to each party. That number is used by each party to calculate a "public_number". Each party shares their "public_number" with the other party.

    Each party can calculate a "shared_key" by using THEIR "secret_number" and the OTHER party's "public_number".

    CODENOTE
    Because adhering to the following results in very long computation times, I have chosen to deviate. But following are the guidelines for selecting "b", "m", and the "secret number".
    "b":
        The base, it's often chosen to be a small prime number or a primitive root modulo "m". While "b" doesn't need to be as large as "m", it should be chosen to ensure the security properties of the Diffie-Hellman exchange are maintained. In many cases, "b" is simply set to 2 or another small number.

    "m":
        You need to generate a large prime number that is at least 2048 bits long for adequate security. This is not something you can do with a simple random byte generator, as the number must be prime, not just random. There are specialized algorithms and libraries designed to generate large prime numbers for cryptographic purposes. For example, OpenSSL provides functionality to generate such prime numbers1.

    "secret_number":
        Randomness: "secret_number" should be randomly generated to ensure that it cannot be guessed or predicted by an attacker.
        Size: The size of "secret_number" should be similar to the size of "m". If "m" is 2048 bits, then "secret_number" should also be a random number that is 2048 bits long.
        Range: "secret_number" should be in the range ( [1, m-2] ). Itâ€™s important that "secret_number" is not too small, as small values can weaken the security of the key exchange.
