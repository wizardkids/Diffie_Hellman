 Description: This program includes two major functions:
     (i) DH key exchange
    (ii) AES encryption

Unlike other encryption programs that I have written, this one includes a mechanism for secure transmission of the key required for decryption. The generate_DH() function generates keys for either the sender or the recipient (but both must have keys!). Both parties have the keys to encrypt/decrypt text.

The "passing" of public keys is done during encryption by reading the public key in the recipient's .json file. The private key needed for encryption is read from the sender's .json file. From these data, a shared key is created and used for encryption. Decryption requires reading the sender's public key and the recipient's private key. The recipient then creates the same shared key that was used by the sender to encrypt the text.

    b^secret_number mod m. This formula is public. b and m are known to both parties. m must be a prime number.

    "secret_number" is known only to the parties and each party has a different "secret_number". In this function, a "secret_number" is selected randomly and assigned to each party. That number is used by each party to calculate a "public_number". Each party shares their "public_number" with the other party.

    Each party can calculate a "shared_key" by using THEIR "secret_number" and the OTHER party's "public_number".

    "b", "m", "secret_number", "public_number", are all values required to calculate a "shared_key". Both the sender and the recipient, with the correct information from the other party, will calculate the same shared key. Because this calculation depends on the "secret_number" that only one party knows, only the sender and recipient can calculate this shared number. That is the magic of Duffie-Hellman key exchange.

    CODENOTE
    Because adhering to the following guidelines results in very long computation times, I have chosen to deviate. But these guidelines are recommended selecting secure values for "b", "m", and the "secret number".
    "b":
        The base, it's often chosen to be a small prime number or a primitive root modulo "m". While "b" doesn't need to be as large as "m", it should be chosen to ensure the security properties of the Diffie-Hellman exchange are maintained. In many cases, "b" is simply set to 2 or another small number.

    "m":
        You need to generate a large prime number that is at least 2048 bits long for adequate security. This is not something you can do with a simple random byte generator, as the number must be prime, not just random. There are specialized algorithms and libraries designed to generate large prime numbers for cryptographic purposes. For example, OpenSSL provides functionality to generate such prime numbers1.

    "secret_number":
        Randomness: "secret_number" should be randomly generated to ensure that it cannot be guessed or predicted by an attacker.
        Size: The size of "secret_number" should be similar to the size of "m". If "m" is 2048 bits, then "secret_number" should also be a random number that is 2048 bits long.
        Range: "secret_number" should be in the range ( [1, m-2] ). Itâ€™s important that "secret_number" is not too small, as small values can weaken the security of the key exchange.
